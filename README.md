# Mini Database Management System (DBMS)  

## Implementation of <key-value> database storage mechanism using efficient Data Structure  

## Data Structure
B+ tree multilevel indexing with index & data hard disk storage capability  

## Special Attributes  
> Easy to understand  
> Programmed in C++ (so it is easy to rewrite program in other languages)  
> Large storage capacity (able to store indexing in range [-2147483648, 2147483647]) with infinity value's length  
> Complexity of O(log(n)) for insertion, search, deletion, modification (very efficient for large number of data)  
> Higher efficiency compared to popular Hash Tables Data Structure  
> Using RAM cache to improvise efficiency but in easy to implement way  
> Clear documentation and API explanation provided  
> Able to perform range search using linked leaves indexing ability of B+ tree
